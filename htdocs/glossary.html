    <h1>Glossary</h1>
    <h2>A</h2>
    <h3>Attribute</h3>
    <p>An attribute extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form name=value (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).</p>

    <h3>API</h3>
    <p">In Web development, an ApI is generally a set of code features (e.g. methods, properties, events, and URLs) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.</p>

    <h2>B</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Browser</h3>
    <p>A Web browser or browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks. A browser is the most familiar type of user agent.</p>

    <h2>C</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>CSS</h3>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks. CSS is one of the three core Web technologies, along with HTML and JavaScript. CSS usually styles HTML elements, but can be also used with other markup languages like SVG or XML. A CSS rule is a set of properties associated with a selector. Here is an example that makes every HTML paragraph yellow against a black background: /* The selector "p" indicate that all paragraphs in the document will be affected by that rule */ p { /* The "color" property defines the text color, in this case yellow. */ color: yellow; /* The "background-color" property defines the background color, in this case black. */ background-color: black } "Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.</p>

    <h2>D</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>DOCTYpE</h3>
    <p>In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYpE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called “quirks mode”when rendering a document; that is, the "" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.</p>

    <h2>E</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Element</h3>
    <p>An element is a part of a webpage. In XML and HTML, an element may contain a data item or a chunk of text or an image, or perhaps nothing. A typical element includes an opening tag with some attributes, enclosed text content, and a closing tag. Elements and tags are not the same things. Tags begin or end an element in source code, whereas elements are part of the DOM, the document model for displaying the page in the browser.</p>

    <h2>F</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <p>Flexbox is the commonly-used name for the CSS Flexible Box Layout Module, a layout model for displaying items in a single dimension — as a row or as a column. In the specification, flexbox is described as a layout model for user interface design. The key feature of flexbox is the fact that items in a flex layout can grow and shrink. Space can be assigned to the items themselves, or distributed between or around the items. Flexbox also enables alignment of items on the main or cross axis, thus providing a high level of control over the size and alignment of a group of items.</p>

    <h2>G</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Global Variable</h3>
    <p>A global variable is a variable that is declared in the global scope in other words, a variable that is visible from all other scopes. In JavaScript it is a property of the global object.</p>

    <h2>H</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>HTML5</h3>
    <p>The latest stable release of HTML, HTML5 takes HTML from a simple markup for structuring a document to a full app development platform. Among other features, HTML5 includes new elements and JavaScript ApIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.</p>

    <h2>I</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>IDE</h3>
    <p>An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Interactive Development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.</p>

    <h2>J</h2>
    <br">
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
    <p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language mostly used to dynamically script webpages on the client side, but it is also often utilized on the server-side, using packages such as Node.js. JavaScript should not be confused with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries. However, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and uses. Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and Internet Explorer 3.0 introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</p>

    <h2>K</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Keyword</h3>
    <p>A keyword is a word or phrase that describes content. Online keywords are used as queries for search engines or as words identifying content on websites. When you use a search engine, you use keywords to specify what you are looking for, and the search engine returns relevant webpages. For more accurate results, try more specific keywords, such as "Blue Mustang GTO" instead of simply "Mustang". Webpages also use keywords in a meta tag (in the section) to describe page content, so search engines can better identify and organize webpages.</p>

    <h2>L</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Local Variable</h3>
    <p>A variable whose name is bound to its value only within a local scope. </p>
    <p>Example Section </p>
    <p>var global = 5; //is a global variable</p>

    <h3>function fun(){</h3>
    <p>var local = 10; //is a local variable </p>
    <p>}</p>
    <h2>M</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Metadata</h3>
    <p>Metadata is — in its very simplest definition — data that describes data. For example, an HTML document is data, but HTML can also contain metadata in its
    <head>
        element that describes the document — for example who wrote it, and its summary.
    </p>

    <h2>N</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Native</h3>
    <p>A native application has been compiled to run on the hardware/software environment that comprises the targeted architecture. An example of a native Android app would be a mobile application written in Java using the Android toolchain. On the other hand, a Web App that runs inside a browser is not native — it is run in the web browser, which sits on top of the native environment, not the native environment itself.</p>

    <h2>O</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Operator</h3>
    <p>Reserved syntax consisting of punctuation or alphanumeric characters that carries out built-in functionality. For example, in JavaScript the addition operator ("+") adds numbers together and concatenates strings, whereas the "not" operator ("!") negates an expression — for example making a true statement return false.</p>

    <h2>p</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>property</h3>
    <p>The term property can have several meanings depending on the context. It may refer to:</p>

    <h3>property (CSS)</h3>
    <p>A CSS property is a characteristic (like color) whose associated value defines one aspect of how the browser should display the element.</p>

    <h3>property (JavaScript)</h3>
    <p>
        A property is a characteristic of an object, often describing attributes associated with a data structure. There are two kinds of properties:
        Instance properties hold data that are specific to a given object instance.
        Static properties hold data that are shared among all object instances.
    </p>

    <h2>Q</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Quality Values</h3>
    <p>Quality values, or q-values and q-factors, are used to describe the order of priority of values in a comma-separated list. It is a special syntax allowed in some HTTp headers and in HTML.The importance of a value is marked by the suffix ';q=' immediately followed by a value between 0 and 1 included, with up to three decimal digits, the highest value denoting the highest priority. When not present, the default value is 1.</p>

    <h2>R</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Ruby</h3>
    <p>Ruby is an open-source programming language. In a Web context, Ruby is often used server-side with the Ruby On Rails (ROR) framework to produce websites/apps.</p>

    <h2>S</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>Syntax specifies the required combination and sequence of characters making up correctly structured code. Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in HTML and JavaScript). Syntax applies both to programming languages (commands to the computer) and markup languages (document structure information). Syntax only governs ordering and structure; the instructions must also be meaningful, which is the province of semantics. </p>
    <p>Code must have correct syntax in order to compile correctly, otherwise a syntax error occurs. Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can keep source code from compiling. Frameworks are said to have a "clean" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results. If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.</p>

    <h2>T</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Tag</h3>
    <p>In HTML a tag is used for creating an element. The name of an HTML element is the nameused in angle brackets such as <p> for paragraph. Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, "</p>", and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed. If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.</p>

    <h2>U</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>URL</h3>
    <p>Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a text string specifying where a resource can be found on the Internet. In the context of HTTp, URLs are called "Web address" or "link". Your browser displays URLs in its address bar, for example</p>
    <p>URLs can also be used for file transfer (FTp) , emails (SMTp), and other applications.</p>

    <h2>V</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Variable</h3>
    <p>A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.</p>

    <h2>W</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>W3C</h3>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international body that maintains Web-relatedrules and frameworks.</p>
    <p>It consists of over 350 member-organizations that jointly develop Web standards, run outreach programs, and maintain an open forum for talking about the Web. The W3C coordinates companies in the industry to make sure they implement the same W3C standards. </p>
    <p>Each standard passes through four stages of maturity: Working Draft (WD), Candidate Recommendation (CR), proposed Recommendation (pR), and W3C Recommendation (REC).</p>

    <h2>X</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>XML</h3>
    <p>eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages. </p>
    <p>XML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-language—that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as RSS. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.</p>
